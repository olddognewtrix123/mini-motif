Have you ever woken up from a dream with a tune in your head? Or heard someone humming something and wanted to recreate it? This is an ultra-simple app that opens in your browser and lets you assemble a quick motif (a very simple and short musical tune). The interface is as basic and as intuitive as possible, to allow people to create a real piece of music without having to learn musical theory or how to play an instrument. This is as basic as using a toy piano, only when you're done, you can export your tune as a .wav file and share with anybody you'd like.
